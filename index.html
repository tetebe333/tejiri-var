        <p class="mText">💕💕 I want you to know that my love for you is not loud, but it is deep. It lives in the little things  in the way I think of you when the day is long, in how your happiness matters to me even more than my own. I care for you in ways words struggle to explain, but my heart understands fully. Every smile of yours feels like peace, and every moment with you reminds me why loving you feels so natural.
        You are more than just my love, you are my safe place. I promise to cherish you, to stand by you, and to care for you with patience and sincerity. No matter where life takes us, my heart chooses you every time. This love is real, it is steady, and it is yours today, tomorrow, and always. 💕💕</p>
